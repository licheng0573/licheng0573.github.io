summary: These brief instructions will help you get started quickly with the how to build a static help center with Jekyll. The other topics in this help provide additional information and detail about working with other aspects of building a help center and Jekyll.

## Step 1 : Installing Jekyll

If you've never installed or run a Jekyll site locally on your computer, follow these instructions to install Jekyll:

* [Install Jekyll on Mac](./2018-01-01-mydoc_install_jekyll_on_mac.md)
* [Install Jekyll on Windows](./2018-01-01-mydoc_install_jekyll_on_windows.md)

Now , try to make a site!  

```
jekyll new my-awesome-site
```

You succeed in this step If you get the sentence like "New jekyll site installed in .../my-awesome-site"

Now browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

## Step 2 : Building a Theme

Jekyll have many theme templates that can be use to develop a website without sophisticated coding.

You can download a theme from 

[resources website]: https://links.jianshu.com/go?to=http%3A%2F%2Fjekyllthemes.org%2F

 or from 

[Github]: https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme

. 

Change into the directory of template file that you have just downloaded and check whether it runs successfully in your computer.

```
jekyll serve
```



If you have errors or bugs in this step, you can try the following steps to quickly fix it:

* replaces the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock files in the theme with that in the my-awesome-site in Step 1.

* changes Gem sources.

  e.g. If you are using the internet in China, you can change the source as “https://gems.ruby-china.com/”

  ```
  --remove https://rubygems.org.
  --add http://gems.ruby-china.com
  ```

  

  

### Attention

#### Option 1: *Without* the github-pages gem {#option1}

Use this option if you're not planning to publish your Jekyll site using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Bundler's Gemfile specifies how project dependencies are managed. Although this project includes a Gemfile, this theme doesn't have any dependencies beyond core Jekyll. The Gemfile is used to list gems needed for publishing on Github Pages. **If you're not planning to have Github Pages build your Jekyll project, delete these two files from the theme's root directory:**

* Gemfile
* Gemfile.lock

If you've never run Jekyll on your computer (you can check with `jekyll --version`), you may need to install the jekyll gem:

```
gem install jekyll
```

Now run jekyll serve (first change directories (`cd`) to where you downloaded the project):

```
jekyll serve
```

#### Option 2: *with* the github-pages gem{#option2}

If you *are* in fact publishing on Github Pages, leave the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock files in the theme.The Gemfile tells Jekyll to use the github-pages gem. **However, note that you cannot use the normal `jekyll serve` command with this gem due to dependency conflicts between the latest version of Jekyll and Github Pages** (which are noted [briefly here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/)).

You need Bundler to resolve these dependency conflicts. Use Bundler to install all the needed Ruby gems:

```
bundle update
```

Then *always* use this command to build Jekyll:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you want to shorten this long command, you can put this code in a file such as jekyll.sh (on a Mac) and then simply type `. jekyll.sh` to build Jekyll.

## Step 3 : Organizing content

### Where to author content

Use a text editor such as Sublime Text, WebStorm, IntelliJ, or [Atom](./2018-01-01-mydoc_atom_text_editor.md)

to create pages. Atom is recommended because it's created by Github, which is driving some of the Jekyll development through Github Pages.

### Where to save content

You can rewrite your pages in the **_pages** or **_posts** file inside the theme file, which are are most basic building block for content. 

The simplest way of adding a page is to add an HTML file in the root directory with a suitable filename. You can also write a page in Markdown using a `.md` extension which converts to HTML on build. 

The site output will pull all of those pages out of their folders and put them into the root directory. Check out the \_site folder, which is where Jekyll is generated, to see the difference between your project's structure and the resulting site output.

### Format of the content

Each file should have the same format in order to be published correctly. The head information part contains the format information (or field value) of this file in layout.

Here below are two sample  pages/posts in different templates. This part should be included in two rows of "---".

e.g.1 A Page

![20190506212736](/20190506212736.png)

e.g.2 A Post

![20190506213513](/20190506213513.png)



### Grammar of the Content

The content **after the head information part** can be created under Markdown or HTML.  

You can changes this part in the files of template folder based on your own need.

This content will replaces the `{{content}}` part in the linked HTML files. For example, the content in e.g. 2 above will replaces the `{{content}}` in `post.html`file under  the layout directory.



More details see authoring in advanced courses of Jekyll.



## Step 4 : Publishing on Github Pages

You can publish your project on Github Pages, which is a free web hosting service provided by Github. All you need is to put your content into a Github repo branch called gh-pages and make this your default branch in your repo. With a Jekyll site, you just commit your entire project into the gh-pages branch and Github Pages will build the site for you.



1. Put your help center website on Github, named it as `<username>.github.io`. <username> means your Github username.

2. Open the _config.yml file and add the following:

   ```
   url: <username>.github.io
   baseurl: /myreponame
   ```

3. Type url above in browser to visit your website.
